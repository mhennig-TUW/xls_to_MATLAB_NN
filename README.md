# xls_to_MATLAB_NN
This is a tool that lets a user define MATLAB NNs as a row in a excel table.
It was created by taking a MATLAB NN setup script, building an excel with all necessary parameters and adapting the script in order to take all the parameters from the excel.
It can be used to ease the creation of neural networks in MATLAB and systematically try out different configurations.
